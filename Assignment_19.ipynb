    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the Python interpreter raises an exception object and stops executing the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code, whereas exceptions occur when the code is syntactically correct but there is an error during its execution. "
