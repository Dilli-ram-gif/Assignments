    "Ans: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects that share similar properties and behaviors. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that has state (data) and behavior (functions). Objects are created from classes and can be used to interact with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate this concept. Suppose we are building a program for a car rental company. We can define a class called \"Car\" that has attributes such as make, model, year, color, and price. The class can also have methods that define the behavior of a car object, such as start(), stop(), accelerate(), and brake()."

    "Ans: The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class. It allows for better data hiding and protects the data from external interference, thereby improving security and reducing code complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class is created from an existing class by inheriting its properties and methods. The new class is called a subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called the superclass or base class. Inheritance allows for code reuse, reduces code duplication, and enables the creation of hierarchical class structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. It allows for code to be written that can work with objects of multiple classes, providing flexibility and extensibility to the program. Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of identifying essential features of an object and ignoring irrelevant details. It allows for the creation of abstract data types that can be used to represent complex systems or concepts. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity, improve code readability, and provide a high-level view of the system being modeled."
