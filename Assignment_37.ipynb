For example, suppose we have the following confidence interval for a population mean: 95% confidence interval = [12.5, 18.5].

    "The sample size affects the margin of error in that as the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This relationship is called an inverse relationship because the two move in opposite directions. A larger sample size will result in a smaller margin of error because it provides more information about the population being studied. For example, if we were to take a sample of 1000 people instead of 100 people, we would expect to get a more accurate estimate of the population mean because we have more data points to work with.\n",

If we take a sample of 1000 voters and find that 55% support the candidate, then we can construct a confidence interval with a lower bound of 52% and an upper bound of 58%. However, if we take a sample of only 100 voters, then our margin of error will be larger and our confidence interval will be wider. For example, if we find that 55% support the candidate in this smaller sample, then our confidence interval would be [45%, 65%], which is much wider than the previous interval."
