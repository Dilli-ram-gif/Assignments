    "Artificial Intelligence(AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and learning. AI is a broad field that encompasses many subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. One example of AI is a chatbot that can understand and respond to customer inquiries.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and then use that knowledge to make predictions or decisions about new data. One example of ML is a spam filter that can learn to recognize and filter out unwanted emails based on patterns in the email content.\n",

    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that involves the development of artificial neural networks that can learn to recognize patterns in data. DL algorithms are designed to model the way the human brain works, with layers of artificial neurons that can learn to recognize increasingly complex patterns in the data. DL algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. One example of DL is a self-driving car that can use deep neural networks to recognize and classify objects in its environment, such as other cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs."
