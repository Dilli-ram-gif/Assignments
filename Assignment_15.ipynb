    "Ans:\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, semi-structured documents rather than fixed schemas like traditional SQL databases. It uses a JSON-like format called BSON to store data, making it easy to work with for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based relational data model used by SQL databases. Instead, they use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family models. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as well as faster read and write speeds, making them ideal for handling large amounts of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, and the data model is likely to change frequently. It is also preferred in scenarios where there is a need for high scalability and performance, such as in big data or real-time data processing applications. Additionally, MongoDB's flexible schema allows for easier integration with modern application development frameworks, making it a popular choice for web and mobile applications. However, SQL databases are still preferred in scenarios where the data is highly structured and relational, such as in financial systems or inventory management systems."

    "Ans: MongoDB has a number of features that make it a popular choice for modern application development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible document data model: MongoDB's document data model allows for flexible and dynamic schema design, making it easy to store and retrieve complex data structures. Documents are stored in BSON format, which supports a wide range of data types, including arrays and nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High scalability: MongoDB's sharding and replication features make it easy to scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing for high availability and performance even with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rich query language: MongoDB's query language, called the MongoDB Query Language (MQL), supports a wide range of queries, including complex aggregations and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and aggregation framework: MongoDB's indexing and aggregation framework allows for efficient query performance, even with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ACID transactions: MongoDB supports ACID transactions at the document level, allowing for consistent and reliable data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Easy integration with modern development frameworks: MongoDB has a robust set of drivers and APIs that make it easy to integrate with popular programming languages and modern development frameworks, such as Node.js, React, and Angular.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Automatic sharding and failover: MongoDB's automatic sharding and failover features make it easy to manage clusters of servers and ensure high availability and performance."

    "Ans: The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query a collection and retrieve documents that match the specified search criteria. The method takes one or more parameters to specify the search criteria, sort order, and projection for the query. The `filter` parameter is used to specify the search criteria for the query, and can include comparison, logical, and array operators to filter the results based on specific fields. The `projection` parameter is used to specify which fields to include or exclude from the results, and can use the dot notation to specify nested fields. The `sort` parameter is used to specify the sort order for the results, and the `limit` and `skip` parameters are used to limit the number of documents returned and skip over a certain number of documents, respectively. The `find()` method returns a cursor object, which can be iterated over to access the documents in the result set."
