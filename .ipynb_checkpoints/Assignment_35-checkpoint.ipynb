    "- A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that models the potential outcomes of a discrete random variable. It assigns probabilities to each possible value of the random variable. For example, consider a coin toss where the outcome can be either heads or tails. The PMF for this random variable would assign a probability of 0.5 to heads and 0.5 to tails.\n",

    "- A Probability Density Function (PDF) is used to describe the outcome of a continuous random variable. It assigns probabilities to ranges of values of the random variable. For example, consider the height of people in a population. The PDF for this random variable would assign probabilities to ranges of heights such as 5’6\" - 5’7\", 5’7\" - 5’8\", etc."
