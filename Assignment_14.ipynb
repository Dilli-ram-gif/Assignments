    "Ans:\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of databases with different data models, structures, and querying languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that organize data into tables with rows and columns, with each row being a unique record. These databases use SQL as their querying language and enforce a fixed schema that defines the structure of the data. SQL databases are widely used for applications that require complex queries, data integrity, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that organize data in a variety of ways, such as document-based, key-value, graph-based, and column-based models. NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexibility, scalability, and high performance. They do not enforce a fixed schema, and data can be added or removed without the need for a predefined structure. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB."
