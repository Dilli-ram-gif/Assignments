    "Multithreading in Python is the ability to run multiple threads (smaller units of a program) simultaneously within a single process. It is used to improve the performance of a program by using multiple CPUs or CPU cores. It helps to perform concurrent tasks efficiently and speed up the execution of the program.\n",

    "Ans: Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously on multiple CPUs or CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to respond to user input while performing time-consuming tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource sharing: Multithreading can allow multiple threads to share resources such as memory and network connections, which can improve the overall efficiency of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modular design: Multithreading can enable a program to be designed in a more modular way, with different threads responsible for different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "1. Complex programming: Multithreading can add complexity to a program, as it requires careful synchronization of threads to prevent errors such as race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource consumption: Multithreading can consume more system resources than a single-threaded program, as each thread requires its own stack and additional overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Debugging difficulties: Multithreaded programs can be more difficult to debug than single-threaded programs, as the behavior of threads can be unpredictable and difficult to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability limitations: Multithreading can be limited by the scalability of the underlying hardware, as adding additional threads beyond a certain point may not result in a proportional increase in performance."
