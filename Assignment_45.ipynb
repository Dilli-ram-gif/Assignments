    "The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding: Assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable based on their order or rank. The order or rank may be based on some inherent characteristic of the categories or determined by the data analyst. For example, assigning 1, 2, and 3 to the categories \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" based on their order of importance.\n",
    "- Label Encoding: Assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable without considering any order or rank. The numerical values are typically assigned arbitrarily or alphabetically. For example, assigning 0, 1, and 2 to the categories \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue\" respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding is suitable when the categories have a clear order or rank, and the ordering is meaningful in the context of the problem. It preserves the ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "- Label Encoding can be chosen when the categories do not have any inherent order or the order does not carry any meaningful information. It is appropriate when treating the categories as distinct and unrelated."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where the categories in a categorical variable are encoded based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. It assigns a higher value to categories that are more likely to be associated with the target variable's positive outcome, and a lower value to categories associated with the negative outcome.\n",
    "- This technique is useful when there is a significant correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable, and you want to capture this relationship in the encoding process. It can help improve the predictive power of the categorical variable in machine learning models."

It is used to assess the dependence or independence between variables in various statistical analyses and modeling techniques.\n",
